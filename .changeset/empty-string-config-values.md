Fixed a config whose value is legitimately the empty string being treated as missing. `getValue` with a string default now returns `""` (reason `found-match`) instead of falling back to the default with reason `value-missing`. When an empty string cannot satisfy the requested type, the evaluation reason now reflects the actual failure (`invalid-number`, `invalid-boolean`, or `invalid-json`) rather than `value-missing`.
