# @configdirector/openfeature-server-provider

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 41e6f0e: Added a `connectionError` client event and hook that fires when the connection to ConfigDirector fails with an unrecoverable error (for example a revoked SDK key), including when the failure happens after the client was already connected and serving configs. Previously such a post-connection fatal error was silent: the transport stopped reconnecting, the client kept reporting ready, and configs quietly went stale with no way to observe it. The error is now also logged at error level.

### Patch Changes

- badf8ae: Fixed a config whose value is legitimately the empty string being treated as missing. `getValue` with a string default now returns `""` (reason `found-match`) instead of falling back to the default with reason `value-missing`. When an empty string cannot satisfy the requested type, the evaluation reason now reflects the actual failure (`invalid-number`, `invalid-boolean`, or `invalid-json`) rather than `value-missing`.
- 48c169c: Fixed the `polling` connection mode leaving its interval timer running after an unrecoverable (4xx) response to a scheduled poll. The transport now closes itself, stopping the useless poll attempts and the repeated warning logs, and `isConnected` correctly reports `false`.
- 556a40e: Fixed the `polling` and `one-time` connection modes permanently stopping after a transient network failure. A thrown network error (device offline, DNS failure, connection reset) is now treated as retryable and polling resumes on the next interval, matching how streaming mode already behaved. Only 4xx responses and permission errors remain unrecoverable.
- 428823f: Fixed `dispose()` on the server client leaving the telemetry flush timer running, which kept the Node.js event loop alive indefinitely and prevented graceful process shutdown. Disposing the client now stops telemetry collection and flushes any pending telemetry events in the background.
- 18a02e4: Fixed numeric config value parsing in `getValue` accepting malformed values: trailing garbage (`"42abc"` returned 42), surrounding whitespace, hexadecimal notation, and multi-dot strings (`"1.2.3"` returned 1.2) are now rejected and return the provided default with the evaluation reason `invalid-number`, matching the strict parsing already used by targeting-rule evaluation. Exponent notation on integer configs now parses to its full value (`"1e3"` is 1000, previously 1). Valid values, including fractional values on integer configs (still truncated), are unaffected.
- 2dc8410: Hardened the telemetry flush loop: an unexpected error thrown during a flush no longer kills telemetry collection permanently with an unhandled promise rejection — it is logged and the next flush is scheduled as usual. A flush already in flight when the client is closed no longer re-arms the flush timer after close, and concurrent flush triggers no longer stack multiple parallel flush timers. Closing the client now always completes cleanup even if the final flush attempt fails.
- 7b57427: Fixed `getValue` returning a raw string of the wrong runtime type when the requested type and the config's declared type are incompatible (for example a boolean default against an integer config, or an object default against a string config). Such mismatches now return the provided default value with the evaluation reason `type-mismatch`. A JSON config whose parsed value does not match the requested type (including a literal `null` requested as an object) also returns the default with `type-mismatch` instead of the wrong-typed value. Enum configs requested as a boolean now parse `"true"`/`"false"` values instead of returning the raw string. String defaults continue to accept any config type as-is, and enum values that cast to a consumer-defined string or numeric enum continue to be returned unchanged.
